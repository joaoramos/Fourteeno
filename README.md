Responsive HTML5 Boilerplate
============================

This is a revised, stripped down blend of Joni Jorkpi's <a href="http://frameless.org">Frameless grid</a> with markup and JavaScript from the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> (3.0) for mobile and a set of 5 media queries I use for **my** responsive HTML5 projects.

Note
----

Please have these observations under consideration:

* All credits to Joni Korpi (for the <a href="http://frameless.org">Frameless grid</a>) and the guys behind <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>;
* I use CodeKit to compile, compact and minify my LESS styles, JavaScript code and optimize my images (hence the `-min` sufix);
* I'm using 5 media queries in a Mobile-first approach: 4, 6, 8, 12 and 14 columns;
* There is **no documentation**. That's why I'd recommend you to check <a href="http://frameless.org">Frameless grid</a>, <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/">320andup</a> for inspiration;
* If you haven't read Ethan Marcotte's <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a>, you're probably doing it wrong.
